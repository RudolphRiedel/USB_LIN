# Hardware
This is an Open Source Hardware USB to LIN Interface.
The design goal of this PCB was to provide two isolated LIN operating as master or node.

## D5035-50
The PCB D5035-50 is based on the ATSAMx51J microcontroller from Microchip.
Any ATSAMx51J1x-Axx can be used, so every variant in TQFP-64, the bootloader and the firmware work on all three memory sizes.

The first prototypes are up and running, populated with ATSAMD51J18A-AU.

## D5035-51
The PCB D5035-50 is based on the ATSAMDA1G16B-ABT microcontroller from Microchip.

The first batch is ordered.
